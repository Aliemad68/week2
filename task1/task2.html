        <h2>Exercise 1: "About Me" Page</h2>
        <p>Create a page named <code>aboutme.html</code> that describes you. You can use DreamWeaver or Notepad++. On your page, include some or all of the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your name</li>
            <li>A description of yourself in two sentences or less. Emphasize the most important word(s) by putting them in <b>bold</b>.</li>
            <li>A list of classes you are taking right now at Temple.</li>
            <li>Your 3 favorite movies, books, or TV shows, in order. Make at least one link to an interesting site about that TV show/movie/book, such as its <a href="https://www.imdb.com" target="_blank">IMDB</a> page.</li>
            <li>Two images, one that represents you when you're happy and one that represents you when you're sad.
                (These can be any images you like. Consider searching for images on <a href="https://images.google.com" target="_blank">Google Image Search</a>.)
            </li>
            <li>Something interesting about one or more of your neighbors (look at computers next to you).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            (You may be tempted to spend all 50 of your minutes on this part of the lab, but try to keep the page somewhat short so that you can attempt some of the other exercises.)
        </p>
        
        <p>To see your page in the web browser, in Firefox, click <b>File</b>, Open File, and browse to your page file to open it.</p>
        
        <p>Write your page using valid XHTML 1.1. Include a link from your page to the W3C XHTML Validator, using the following image and linking to the following site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>image: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11">http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml11</a></li>
            <li>site: <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer">http://validator.w3.org/check/referer</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The next task will be to write a stylesheet for your page, so also include a link to the W3C CSS Validator, using the following image and linking to the following site:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>image: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss</a></li>
            <li>site: <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer</a></li>
        </ul>
